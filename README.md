MediTree

MediTree is a C++ program that serves as a comprehensive Hospital Patient Management System. It uses a binary search tree (BST) data structure to efficiently manage patient records and facilitate various operations related to hospital management. This program is designed to handle patient admissions, record search, data manipulation, and more.

Features:

Insert new patient records with automatic adjustment near the root for efficient access.
Search and retrieve patient records while dynamically reorganizing records for faster retrieval.
Remove existing patient records from the system.
Edit patient records to update information.
Split patient records into two separate BSTs based on the median patient ID.
Print records of all admitted patients.
Print records of specific patients using their unique IDs.

Example:

Here's a brief example of how the program operates:

Insert Records: New patient records can be inserted into the system, and they are automatically adjusted for efficient access near the root.
Search and Level Adjustment: The system allows you to search for patient records based on their IDs and adjust their levels within the BST for faster access.
Delete Records: You can remove patient records from the system.
Edit Records: Existing patient records can be edited to update their information.
Splitting Records: The program can split patient records into two separate BSTs based on the median patient ID, ensuring balanced data distribution.
Printing: You can print records of all admitted patients and specific patients using their IDs.
